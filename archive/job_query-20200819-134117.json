You\u2019ll also integrate usability principles and established standards to inform the design process. If you need more information, you\u2019ll do some of your own guerilla user research, hopping on the phone with one of our coaches or checking the Facebook group to identify pain points and improve your design.\n\nMaintaining and iterating.\n\nYou aren\u2019t finished once the site is deployed \u2014 you\u2019ll continually initiate ideas to enhance the digital experience, improve conversion, and drive sales. You\u2019ll keep up with user feedback and participate in A/B testing to inform improvements and updates over time.\n\nDefine, document and evolve web design standards.\n\nYou\u2019ll develop and refine standards and guidelines that serve as the foundation for designing cohesive experiences across PN web sites.\n\n\nA few important caveats\n\nThis is a dream job, if you\u2019re the right person for it.\n\nMust-Have #1: You must be experienced.\n\nThis isn\u2019t your first rodeo. You have at least 5 years of experience as a web site user experience designer for a consumer e-commerce website and have professional knowledge of user-centered design, usability principles and techniques. You know how to code on a basic level or have a strong understanding of how technology affects design. It\u2019s not just about the design, but how it will function too. If you have experience doing user research and developing design systems, that\u2019s a big plus. You must have a portfolio with examples of work to submit\u2014and if you can share the results that work drove for the company, all the better.\n\nMust-Have #2: You must have experience working closely with others on Agile teams.\n\nYou have experience working on Agile teams and enjoy working with a multidisciplinary team in an ever-changing, fast moving environment to solve challenges. You won\u2019t just be drafting a design, handing it off, and moving onto the next thing. You\u2019ll be working side-by-side with a small team, constantly iterating and improving.\n\nMust-Have #3: You must be able to wear multiple hats.\n\nPN is not a rigid structure. You\u2019ll have your team, but you may also be asked to hop on another project when it\u2019s needed, or switch gears. If you can heed that call and keep a few balls in the air, you\u2019ll excel here.\n\nWondering if this is the right path for you?\n\nEvery year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.\n\nHere are some reasons why.\n\nReason #1: We give you the freedom to \u201cdo you.\u201d\n\nUnlike most companies, we don\u2019t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You\u2019ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want.\n\nReason #2: You can work from anywhere.\n\nWe\u2019re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. When you join our team, you\u2019re no longer shackled to one desk, one office, one city, or even one country!\n\nReason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)\n\nYou\u2019re an adult. You\u2019re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don\u2019t think you need to attend a meeting, you don\u2019t. Simple as that.\n\nReason #4: You\u2019ll always feel supported.\n\nIn a regular office, it\u2019s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other\u2019s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.\n\nReason #5: You\u2019ll never be bored.\n\nPeople often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you\u2019ll get the chance to conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.\n\nReason #6: You\u2019re free to be you.\n\nAt Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives\u2014no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome\u2014as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.\n\nPlus: no commute ... and no 9-to-5 grind.\n\nGo ahead: schedule work around your kids. Fly to Europe on a moment\u2019s notice. We don\u2019t care where you\u2019re based or what hours you keep, as long as you always give us your best when it counts.\n\nSound like we might just be the perfect company for you?

When creating designs, you\u2019re always putting yourself in the visitor\u2019s shoes, questioning whether it\u2019s relevant enough, intuitive enough, interesting enough, and clear enough.\n\nDesign is in your blood.\n\nYou have a natural affinity for design that tells you when something looks, feels, and sounds good.

That means:\n\nShaping solutions for user-centered problems.\n\nYou\u2019ll understand our customers and prospects deeply \u2014 who they are, what jobs they hire us for, and the qualitative or quantitative data needed to understand their optimal user experience. You\u2019ll participate in the development of actionable user personas, journey maps and use cases for each audience persona to inform digital experience design and development.

You have at least 5 years of experience as a web site user experience designer for a consumer e-commerce website and have professional knowledge of user-centered design, usability principles and techniques. You know how to code on a basic level or have a strong understanding of how technology affects design. It\u2019s not just about the design, but how it will function too. If you have experience doing user research and developing design systems, that\u2019s a big plus. You must have a portfolio with examples of work to submit\u2014and if you can share the results that work drove for the company, all the better.\n\nMust-Have #2: You must have experience working closely with others on Agile teams.\n\nYou have experience working on Agile teams and enjoy working with a multidisciplinary team in an ever-changing, fast moving environment to solve challenges. You won\u2019t just be drafting a design, handing it off, and moving onto the next thing. You\u2019ll be working side-by-side with a small team, constantly iterating and improving.\n\nMust-Have #3: You must be able to wear multiple hats.\n\nPN is not a rigid structure. You\u2019ll have your team, but you may also be asked to hop on another project when it\u2019s needed, or switch gears. If you can heed that call and keep a few balls in the air, you\u2019ll excel here.\n\nWondering if this is the right path for you?\n\nEvery year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.\n\nHere are some reasons why.\n\nReason #1: We give you the freedom to \u201cdo you.\u201d\n\nUnlike most companies, we don\u2019t have rigid rules about how and when to do things.

You\u2019re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don\u2019t think you need to attend a meeting, you don\u2019t. Simple as that.\n\nReason #4: You\u2019ll always feel supported.\n\nIn a regular office, it\u2019s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other\u2019s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.\n\nReason #5: You\u2019ll never be bored.\n\nPeople often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you\u2019ll get the chance to conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.\n\nReason #6: You\u2019re free to be you.\n\nAt Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives\u2014no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome\u2014as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work.
