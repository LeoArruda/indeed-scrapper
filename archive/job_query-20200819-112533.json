You have at least 5 years of experience as a web site user experience designer for a consumer e-commerce website and have professional knowledge of user-centered design, usability principles and techniques. You know how to code on a basic level or have a strong understanding of how technology affects design. It\u2019s not just about the design, but how it will function too. If you have experience doing user research and developing design systems, that\u2019s a big plus. You must have a portfolio with examples of work to submit\u2014and if you can share the results that work drove for the company, all the better.\n\nMust-Have #2: You must have experience working closely with others on Agile teams.\n\nYou have experience working on Agile teams and enjoy working with a multidisciplinary team in an ever-changing, fast moving environment to solve challenges. You won\u2019t just be drafting a design, handing it off, and moving onto the next thing. You\u2019ll be working side-by-side with a small team, constantly iterating and improving.\n\nMust-Have #3: You must be able to wear multiple hats.\n\nPN is not a rigid structure. You\u2019ll have your team, but you may also be asked to hop on another project when it\u2019s needed, or switch gears. If you can heed that call and keep a few balls in the air, you\u2019ll excel here.\n\nWondering if this is the right path for you?\n\nEvery year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.\n\nHere are some reasons why.\n\nReason #1: We give you the freedom to \u201cdo you.\u201d\n\nUnlike most companies, we don\u2019t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You\u2019ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want.\n\nReason #2: You can work from anywhere.\n\nWe\u2019re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. When you join our team, you\u2019re no longer shackled to one desk, one office, one city, or even one country!\n\nReason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)\n\nYou\u2019re an adult. You\u2019re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don\u2019t think you need to attend a meeting, you don\u2019t. Simple as that.\n\nReason #4: You\u2019ll always feel supported.\n\nIn a regular office, it\u2019s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things.
